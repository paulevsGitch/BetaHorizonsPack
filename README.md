Beta Horizons is a modular long-term projects that represents "my game vision" of Minecraft Beta 1.7.3.

The project is based on Babric (beta Fabric) and StAPI (Station API). Both tools introduces modern code practices, flexibility and usage of modern Java 17. Unlike many old and legacy mods all patches to Minecraft code are compatible with each other - instead of base edits tools use mixins.

All project parts are logical modules that can be enabled or disabled depending on player needs (which provides a good customisation for players). Most modules also have configs and options, so it is possible to customize modules individually.
